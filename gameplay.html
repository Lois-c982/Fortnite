      <h2>Mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        Fortnite offers a diverse array of gameplay mechanics that have evolved since its launch in 2017. The core Battle Royale mode, introduced in September
        2017, features a unique building mechanic allowing players to construct structures for defense and mobility. In March 2022, Epic Games introduced the
        Zero Build mode, removing the building aspect and adding an overshield mechanic, providing an alternative playstyle for those preferring combat without
        construction (Wikipedia, 2025). In December 2018, Fortnite expanded with the Creative mode, enabling players to design and share their own islands and
        game modes, fostering a sandbox environment within the game (Wikipedia, 2025). This was further enhanced in March 2023 with the release of Unreal Editor
        for Fortnite (UEFN), offering advanced tools for content creation and integration with Unreal Engine 5 (Wikipedia, 2025). Additionally, Fortnite has
        introduced various special modes and events, such as the Impostors mode in August 2021, inspired by social deduction games like Among Us (As.com, 2021),
        and the Godzilla event in January 2025, where players could transform into Godzilla using a Hollow Earth Rift Gate portal (The Sun, 2025). These
        additions demonstrate Fortnite's commitment to evolving gameplay mechanics and providing diverse experiences for its player base.

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <p>
        Fortnite offers a versatile control system that adapts to various platforms and playstyles, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience. On
        consoles, players can choose from several control schemes, including "Combat Pro," "Builder Pro," and "Standard," each offering different layouts for
        building and combat actions. For instance, "Builder Pro" was introduced to streamline building mechanics by assigning each structure to a dedicated
        button, enhancing efficiency during fast-paced encounters. These control schemes were implemented to cater to different player preferences and improve
        gameplay fluidity.On PC, players have the flexibility to remap keys for various actions, such as building, combat, and inventory management, providing a
        tailored experience to suit individual preferences. Additionally, Fortnite supports both mouse-and-keyboard and controller inputs, allowing players to
        switch between the two methods seamlessly. This cross-input compatibility ensures that players can choose their preferred method of control without
        compromising performance.In 2019, Epic Games introduced Bluetooth controller support for mobile devices, enabling players to connect compatible
        controllers to their smartphones for a more traditional gaming experience. This update expanded the accessibility of Fortnite, allowing players to enjoy
        the game with a familiar control setup on mobile platforms.Furthermore, the introduction of gyro and Flick Stick controls in 2022 provided players with
        enhanced aiming precision. Gyro controls allow players to aim by physically tilting their controller, offering a more intuitive aiming experience. Flick
        Stick, developed by Julian "Jibb" Smart, enables rapid camera movement by flicking the right stick, mimicking mouse-like aiming on a controller. These
        features were integrated to offer players more control options and improve aiming accuracy. Overall, Fortnite's control system is designed to be flexible
        and inclusive, accommodating various input methods and allowing players to customize their controls to enhance their gameplay experience.

    <!-- Strategies Section -->
    <section class="intro">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Fortnite offers a variety of gameplay strategies that cater to different playstyles and game modes. In the traditional Battle Royale mode, players
          often employ building techniques to gain the high ground, such as constructing 1x1 towers or using double ramps for offensive maneuvers. Advanced
          strategies include editing structures to create windows or doors for ambushes and utilizing traps to outsmart opponents (Toxigon, 2024). With the
          introduction of Zero Build mode in 2022, the emphasis shifted towards traditional combat and positioning. Players now rely on mobility items like
          Shockwave Grenades and Rift-to-Go to navigate the map and engage enemies effectively (Dignitas, 2025). Mastering movement techniques, such as sliding
          and sprinting, has become crucial for evading attacks and gaining tactical advantages (Dignitas, 2025).Additionally, Fortnite's dynamic events, like
          the Godzilla crossover in 2025, introduce unique gameplay elements that require players to adapt their strategies. During such events, players can
          transform into Godzilla using a Hollow Earth Rift Gate, gaining special abilities to dominate opponents (The Sun, 2025). These events add layers of
          complexity and excitement, encouraging players to continuously evolve their strategies to secure victory.
