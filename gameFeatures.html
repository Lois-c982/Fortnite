        Fortnite offers a dynamic range of game modes that cater to every type of player. In the flagship Battle Royale mode, 100 players are dropped onto an
         ever-changing island where strategy, quick reflexes, and resourceful scavenging all contribute to the ultimate objective: being the last survivor standing. 
         Beyond this fierce combat experience, Fortnite Creative gives players a sandbox environment to design custom games, build immersive worlds, and share their
        creative vision with the community. Meanwhile, Save the World blends tower defense and survival gameplay, challenging players to cooperate in fending off 
        zombie-like creatures while strategically utilizing in-game resources.

            weapons and accessories, each item not only enhances visual appeal but also adds an element of personal 
            flair to the gameplay experience. Characters are deeply themed and often draw inspiration from pop culture,
            and new items are continually introduced to keep the game fresh and exciting. To add an extra layer of engagement
